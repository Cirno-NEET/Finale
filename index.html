Squarespace is the easy way to create your very own professional website using simple drag and drop actions, no matter if you're trying to open a digital storefront or finally starting that travel blog you were always talking about. The home page of the Notre Dame most likely wasn't made using Squarespace, but if it was, they could update it to reflect the tragic events on Monday, the 15th of April, with just a few clicks.
